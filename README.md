📡 MIMO Channel Capacity Calculator (Python + GUI)

This project provides a simple and interactive Python GUI application for calculating the channel capacity of a MIMO communication system using user-defined SNR and number of transmit/receive antennas.

The GUI is built using Tkinter, and the capacity computation uses the classical MIMO Shannon formula under Rayleigh fading.
